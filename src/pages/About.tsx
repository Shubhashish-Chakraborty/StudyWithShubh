                    <p>
                        What started as a simple curiosity and passion for technology has now grown into something truly meaningful. Through my journey of learning and exploring tech, I realized the joy of sharing knowledge and helping others. Thatâ€™s when I decided to take the next stepâ€”launching <strong>studywithshubh.tech</strong>, a platform dedicated to tech learning.

                        ðŸš€ <strong>About StudyWithShubh</strong><br />
                        SWS is not just a website; it's a community-driven tech learning platform where I serve as both tutor and enthusiast. With every lecture I teach and every doubt I help solve, my goal is to empower students to not just learn but truly understand and excel in tech.
                    </p>

                        âœ¨ <strong>Why This Initiative?</strong><br />
                        It started with me conducting live classes and assisting juniors, but over time, this evolved into a startup-like project. The website, built entirely out of my learning, showcases my passion for tech and my commitment to fostering growth in others.
